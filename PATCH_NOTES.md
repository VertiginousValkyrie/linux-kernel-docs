# Patch Notes for Linux Kernel Documentation Updates

## Commit: 01c5c2489e23
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Author:** Meeri Kallio

### Summary:
Added a humorous introduction to the 'Minimal requirements to compile the Kernel' section in the documentation to make it more engaging and approachable.

### Reason:
This patch aims to lighten the tone of the documentation, making it more readable and enjoyable, especially for newcomers who might be intimidated by the technical content.

### Additional notes:
- The humor references older technology (e.g., 90â€™s era software) to create a nostalgic feel.
- No functional changes to the kernel itself, purely documentation.
