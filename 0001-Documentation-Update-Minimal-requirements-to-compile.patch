 Intro
 =====
 
-This document is designed to provide a list of the minimum levels of
-software necessary to run the current kernel version.
+Welcome to the stone age of software, where your trusty 386 processor struggles
+to keep up and floppy disks are still considered high-tech. This document
+lists the bare minimum software versions needed to compile the Linux kernel
+— because if you’re still running GCC 4.8, congratulations, you’re officially
+living in a museum!
 
-This document is originally based on my "Changes" file for 2.0.x kernels
-and therefore owes credit to the same people as that file (Jared Mauch,
-Axel Boldt, Alessandro Sigala, and countless other users all over the
-'net).
+Originally based on the legendary "Changes" file for the 2.0.x kernels, so
+respect goes out to Jared Mauch, Axel Boldt, Alessandro Sigala, and the countless
+users who survived the dial-up era.
 
 Current Minimal Requirements
 ****************************
 
-Upgrade to at **least** these software revisions before thinking you've
-encountered a bug!  If you're unsure what version you're currently
-running, the suggested command should tell you.
+Upgrade to at **least** these software revisions before you start blaming
+the kernel for your problems! Unsure what version you're running? Use the
+commands below to find out.
 
-Again, keep in mind that this list assumes you are already functionally
-running a Linux kernel.  Also, not all tools are necessary on all
-systems; obviously, if you don't have any PC Card hardware, for example,
-you probably needn't concern yourself with pcmciautils.
+Keep in mind, this list assumes you’re already somehow running a Linux kernel.
+Not all tools are necessary on every system; for example, if you don’t have
+any PC Card hardware, feel free to ignore pcmciautils.
